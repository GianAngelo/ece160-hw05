Given the provided `Student.h` and `main.cpp`, write a `Student.cpp` file that implements the methods declared in 
`Student.h`. Your project MUST build with the provided `Makefile`, though you may modify the `Makefile` to use
`g++` instead of `clang++` if you don't have clang available locally. 

You should be able to build your project simply by typing `make` at the command line from within the project directory.

When you run `./hw05`, it should produce the exact output in `example_output.txt`.

When I test your program, I will use a different `main.cpp`, so make sure your implementations are generally applicable!
